PictureFetcher
==============

Downloads pictures and movie clips from SD card and puts them into appropriate date-based folders

Configure your folders at the end of the script:

source_dir - path to your SD card reader drive or any other source of images and movies

target_dir_images - path to the root of a directory you want to put your images (JPG files)

target_dir_movies - path to the root of a directory you want to put your movies (MOV files)



Date-based directory structures will be created. If a picture was taken on May 27th 2014, it will be placed into ${target_dir_images}/2014/2014-05/2014-05-27/ directory.
